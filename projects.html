                <p>Getting teachers to embrace new technology isn't always easy. It's often too hard to use, takes too long
                    to set up or is just any better than the old way. With the introduction of OneNote Class Notebooks and
                    Office 365, Royal Wootton Bassett Academy (RWBA) looked at how they could integrate class notebooks into
                    lessons as easily as possible.</p>
                <p>I am working with RWBA to develop a bespoke intranet, giving pupils and staff quick access to the notebooks
                    they needed for the day. Integration with the school's existing SIS allowed at-a-glance access of timetables
                    and student information, as well as announcements and events from Sharepoint Online.</p>

                    but also stores information about the manifests, packages and payloads stored within the update.

                <p>
                    For HackSheffield 3.0, our team developed a web app designed to make saving money easy and rewarding. Using the Capital One
                    Nessie API, we developed a virtual creature called "Banki", which the user could buy food and items for.
                    When the user purchased an item, it moved money from their current account into their savings and work
                    towards a goal. The project won the "Change Banking for Good by Capital One" prize at HackSheffield 3.0

                    people to order pizza via twitter. Customers would simply sign up with PizzaShed and tweet their order,
                    where it would be picked up by staff and prepared.

                <p>As part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, I created a system to help PE teachers track scores in
                    matches, and calculate rankings for students based on the games they win and lose. The program used the
                    Elo ranking system which takes into account not only the amount of games won and lost, but the ranking
                    of the opponent to help ensure a fair reflection of the players ability.</p>

                <img src="images/sports_day.png" class="portfolio-img" />
                <p>When approached by the head of P.E. to record scores for the school's annual sport's day, I didn't realise
                    how much work it could be. With dozens of Excel sheets, huge formulas, and paper everywhere, I knew there
                    must be a better way.</p>
                <p>Using the Yii framework, I built a basic web app to help track scores. By allowing multiple students to enter
                    scores simultaneously and search the database of students in the school, data entry was many times faster
                    and much more accurate. Students and staff could also see the real time scores on the interactive kiosks
                    around the school.</p>
